    testimonial:
      "When I initially came up with the idea of LingHacks, I had no clue where to start in terms of getting nonprofit status, handling legal paperwork, or raising and storing funds--Hack+ managed all of that seamlessly and made it possible for my team and me to focus on outreach and curriculum. They made it super easy to invoice sponsors, keep track of attendee registrations, and communicate with my team. My team and I are eternally grateful to Hack+ for getting us where we are today!",

    testimonial:
      "Garuda Hacks was organized at the very last moment with only 2.5 months          left in our hands, and it wouldn't have been possible without the Hack+ infrastructure that abstracted away the complexity of raising sponsorship and making vendor payments. As a result,          we were able to put more energy into logistics, marketing, and hacker experience, making          Garuda Hacks Indonesia's largest hackathon, with 2500+ participants, and receiving the          support of Indonesia's Ministry of Tourism and Creative Economy.",
